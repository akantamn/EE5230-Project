EE5230-Project
==============

Papers, code and documentation for a term project in a graduate Power System Optmization class. 

As installed cost of renewables continues to decrease around the world,
providing reliable and affordable energy is starting to become a challenge
for grid operators due to the intermittent and non-dispatchable nature of
renewable energy sources. This project examines a very simplifed process
of planning, designing and dispatching generation using the example of
a five-bus microgrid system containing distinct resource types. The re-
sources consist of conventional dispatchable generation, non-dispatchable
generation from renewable resources and integrated demand re-sponse. Using Matlab and GAMS, economic dispatch of generators was done by DC Optimal Power Flow within
generator constraints . The report includes a discussion on the perfor-
mance of the approach along with its merits and demerits. Historical load
and generation data were used as inputs. The microgrid was operated for
cost minimization within operating constraints, but can be operated for emission eimination and other constraints in the future.
