function N = getN(om, selector, name, idx)
%GETN  Returns the number of variables, constraints or cost rows.
%   N = GETN(OM, SELECTOR)
%   N = GETN(OM, SELECTOR, NAME)
%   N = GETN(OM, SELECTOR, NAME, IDX)
%
%   Returns either the total number of variables/constraints/cost rows
%   or the number corresponding to a specified named block.
%
%   Examples:
%       N = getN(om, 'var')         : total number of variables
%       N = getN(om, 'lin')         : total number of linear constraints
%       N = getN(om, 'nln')         : total number of nonlinear constraints
%       N = getN(om, 'cost')        : total number of cost rows (in N)
%       N = getN(om, 'var', name)   : number of variables in named set
%       N = getN(om, 'lin', name)   : number of linear constraints in named set
%       N = getN(om, 'nln', name)   : number of nonlinear cons. in named set
%       N = getN(om, 'cost', name)  : number of cost rows (in N) in named set
%       N = getN(om, 'var', name, idx) : number of variables in indexed named set
