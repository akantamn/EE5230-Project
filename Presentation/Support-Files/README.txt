 INTRODUCTION
--------------

MATPOWER is a package of MATLAB(R) M-files for solving power flow and
optimal power flow problems. It is intended as a simulation tool for
researchers and educators that is easy to use and modify. MATPOWER
is designed to give the best performance possible while keeping the code
simple to understand and modify. It was initially developed as part
of the PowerWeb project <http://www.pserc.cornell.edu/powerweb/>.

MATPOWER can be downloaded from the MATPOWER home page above.

-----------------
 GETTING STARTED
-----------------

System Requirements
-------------------
    - MATLAB(R) version 7 or later (available from The MathWorks, Inc.
      http://www.mathworks.com/), or
    - GNU Octave version 3.4 or later (free software available from
      http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/).

Installation
------------
1.  Follow the download instructions on the MATPOWER home page. You
    should end up with a file named matpowerXXX.zip, where XXX depends
    on the version of MATPOWER.

2.  Unzip the downloaded file. Move the resulting matpowerXXX directory
    to the location of your choice. These files should not need to be
    modified, so it is recommended that they be kept separate from your
    own code. Let $MATPOWER denote the path to this directory.

3.  Add the following directories to your MATLAB path:
      $MATPOWER   - core MATPOWER functions
      $MATPOWER/t - test scripts for MATPOWER
      (optional) subdirectories of $MATPOWER/extras -
            additional functionality and contributed code

4.  At the MATLAB prompt, type 'test_matpower' (without the quotes) to
    run the test suite and verify that MATPOWER is properly installed
    and functioning.

Running MATPOWER
----------------
To run a simple Newton power flow on the 9-bus system specified in the
file case9.m, with the default algorithm options, at the MATLAB prompt,
type:

    runpf('case9')

To load the 30-bus system data from case30.m, increase its real power
demand at bus 2 to 30 MW, then run an AC optimal power flow with
default options, type:

    define_constants;
    mpc = loadcase('case30');
    mpc.bus(2, PD) = 30;
    runopf(mpc);

By default, the results of the simulation are pretty-printed to the
screen, but the solution can also be optionally returned in a 'results'
struct. The following example shows how simple it is, after running a DC
OPF on the 118-bus system in case118.m, to access the final objective
function value, the real power output of generator 6 and the power flow
in branch 51.

    results = rundcopf('case118');
    final_objective = results.f;
    gen6_output     = results.gen(6, PG);
    branch51_flow   = results.branch(51, PF);

For additional info, see the User's Manual and the on-line help
documentation for the various MATPOWER functions. For example:
    help runpf
    help runopf
    help mpoption
    help caseformat

 WHAT'S NEW IN VERSION 5.0b1
-----------------------------

Below is a summary of the changes since version 4.1 of MATPOWER. See the
CHANGES file in the docs directory for all the gory details.

* New features:
  - Continuation power flow with tangent predictor and Newton
    method corrector, based on code contributed by Shrirang Abhyankar
    and Alex Flueck.
  - SDP_PF, a set of applications of a semidefinite programming
    relaxation of the power flow equations, contributed by
    Dan Molzahn (see 'extras/sdp_pf'):
    - Globally optimal AC OPF solver (under certain conditions).
    - Functions to check sufficient conditions for:
      - global optimality of OPF solution
      - insolvability of power flow equations
  - PSS/E RAW data conversion to MATPOWER case format (experimental)
    based on code contributed by Yujia Zhu.
  - Brand new extensible MATPOWER options architecture based on options
    struct instead of options vector.
  - Utility routines to check network connectivity and handle islands
    and isolated buses.
  - New and updated support for 3rd party solvers:
    - CPLEX 12.6
    - GLPK
    - Gurobi 5.x
    - Knitro 9.x.x
  - Numerous performance enhancements.
  - New functions:
    - runcpf() for continuation power flow.
    - case_info() for summarizing system information, including network
      connectivity.
    - extract_islands() to extract a network island into a separate
      MATPOWER case.
    - find_islands() to detect network islands.
    - @opt_model/describe_idx() to identify variable, constraint or
      cost row indices to aid in debugging.
    - margcost() for computing the marginal cost of generation.
    - psse2mpc() to convert PSS/E RAW date into MATPOWER case format.
  - Added case5.m, a 5-bus, 5-generator example case from Rui Bo.
  - New options:
    - scale_load() can scale corresponding gencost for dispatchable loads.
    - makeJac() can return full Jacobian instead of reduced version
      used in Newton power flow updates.
    - modcost() can accept a vector of shift/scale factors.
  - Reimplementated @opf_model class as sub-class of the new
    @opt_model class, which supports indexed named sets of
    variables, constraints and costs.
  - Many new tests in test suite.

* Bugs fixed:
  - Running a power flow for a case with DC lines but no gencost
    no longer causes an error.
  - Fixed a bug in runpf() where it was using the wrong initial
    voltage magnitude for generator buses marked as PQ buses. Power
    flow of solved case was not converging in zero iterations as
    expected.
  - Fixed fatal bug in MIPS for unconstrained, scalar problems.
    Thanks to Han Na Gwon.
  - Fixed a bug in int2ext() where converting a case to internal
    ordering before calling runpf() or runopf() could result in
    a fatal error due to mismatched number of columns in internal
    and external versions of data matrices. Thanks to Nasiruzzaman
    and Shiyang Li for reporting and detailing the issue.
  - DC OPF now correctly sets voltage magnitudes to 1 p.u.
    in results.
  - Fixed a bug in MIPS where a near-singular matrix could produce
    an extremely large Newton step, resulting in incorrectly satisfying
    the relative feasibility criterion for successful termination.
  - Improved the starting point created for Ipopt, Knitro and MIPS
    for variables that are only bounded on one side.
  - Fixed bug in savecase() where the function name mistakenly
    included the path when the FNAME input included a path.
  - Fixed bugs in runpf() related to enforcing generator reactive
    power limits when all generators violate limits or when
    the slack bus is converted to PQ.
  - Fixed crash when using Knitro to solve cases with all
    lines unconstrained.
  - Fixed memory issue resulting from nested om fields when
    repeatedly running an OPF using the results of a previous
    OPF as input. Thanks to Carlos Murillo-Sanchez.

* INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES:
  - Optional packages TSPOPF and MINOPF must be updated to latest
    versions.
  - Removed 'max_it' option from qps_matpower() (and friends) args.
    Use algorithm specific options to control iteration limits.
  - Changed behavior of branch angle difference limits so that
    0 is interpreted as unbounded only if both ANGMIN and ANGMAX
    are zero.
  - In results struct returned by an OPF, the value of
    results.raw.output.alg is now a string, not an old-style numeric
    alg code.
  - Removed:
    - Support for Matlab 6.x.
    - Support for constr() and successive LP-based OPF solvers.
    - Support for Gurobi 4.x/gurobi_mex() interface.
    - extras/cpf, replaced by runcpf().
    - extras/psse2matpower, replaced by psse2mpc().

 DOCUMENTATION
---------------

There are two primary sources of documentation for MATPOWER.
    - MATLAB's 'help' command
    - MATPOWER User's Manual

The User's Manual is included in the distribution (docs/manual.pdf) or
it can be downloaded separately from
http://www.pserc.cornell.edu/matpower/manual.pdf.

Each M-file has its own documentation which can be accessed by typing at
the MATLAB prompt:

    help <name of M-file>

Documentation for the case data file format can be found by typing:

    help caseformat

If something is still unclear after checking the manual and the help,
the source code *is* the documentation. ;-)
