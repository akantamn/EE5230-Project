function [groups, unvisited] = connected_components(C, groups, unvisited)
%CONNECTED_COMPONENTS Returns the connected components of a graph
%   [GROUPS, ISOLATED] = CONNECTED_COMPONENTS(C)
%
%   Returns the connected components of a directed graph, specified by
%   a node-branch incidence matrix C, where C(I, J) = -1 if node J is
%   connected to the beginning of branch I, 1 if it is connected to
%   the end of branch I, and zero otherwise. The return value GROUPS
%   is a cell array of vectors of the node indices for each component.
%   The second return value ISOLATED is a vector of indices of isolated
%   nodes that have no connecting branches.

%   Can also be called with a current GROUP and list of as-yet
%   UNVISITED nodes:
%   [GROUPS, UNVISITED] = CONNECTED_COMPONENTS(C, GROUPS, UNVISITED)
%   Internally, this is used recursively.
